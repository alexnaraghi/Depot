<objective>
Create community files for public GitHub repository: CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, and issue templates.

Purpose: These files establish community norms, help contributors get started, and provide structured ways to report issues and request features.

Output: Community files at project root and .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ directory

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create CONTRIBUTING.md</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
Create CONTRIBUTING.md with development setup and contribution guidelines.

**Sections:**

1. **Welcome**
   - Thank contributors for interest
   - Link to CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

2. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js 18+ and npm
   - Rust 1.75+ with cargo
   - Windows 10 or later (Tauri targets Windows)
   - Perforce CLI (p4.exe) for testing

3. **Development Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/depot.git
   cd depot
   npm install
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

4. **Project Structure**
   - `src/` — React frontend (TypeScript)
   - `src-tauri/` — Rust backend (Tauri commands)
   - `.planning/` — Development history and methodology

5. **Running Tests**
   - Unit tests: `npm test`
   - E2E tests: Require P4 server setup (see tests/README)

6. **Pull Request Process**
   - Fork and create feature branch
   - Follow existing code style (Prettier, rustfmt)
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Open PR against `main` branch
   - Describe changes and motivation

7. **Questions?**
   - Open a GitHub Discussion or Issue
  </action>
  <verify>
- File exists: `ls CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Contains setup instructions: `grep -c "npm install\|cargo\|tauri dev" CONTRIBUTING.md` returns 3+

  <done>CONTRIBUTING.md exists with prerequisites, setup instructions, project structure, and PR process</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</name>
  <files>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</files>
  <action>
Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md using Contributor Covenant 2.1 (standard for open source projects).

**Key sections:**
1. Our Pledge — inclusive, harassment-free environment
2. Our Standards — positive behavior examples, unacceptable behavior
3. Enforcement Responsibilities — maintainer duties
4. Scope — applies to project spaces and public representation
5. Enforcement — reporting to project maintainers
6. Enforcement Guidelines — correction, warning, temporary ban, permanent ban
7. Attribution — Contributor Covenant 2.1 link

Use the standard Contributor Covenant template text. This is widely recognized and establishes trust with contributors.

**SECURITY.md:**

1. **Supported Versions**
