# Roadmap: P4Now

## Overview

P4Now delivers a non-blocking Windows Perforce GUI. v1.0 MVP established the async-first architecture and core daily workflows (sync, submit, changelists, file operations).

## Completed Milestones

### v1.0 MVP (2026-01-28)

**2 phases, 14 plans, 104 min total execution**

See `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md` for full details.

Key accomplishments:
- Async-first architecture (never blocks UI)
- Process management with reliable cancellation
- File tree with P4V-style status icons
- Changelist management and submit workflow
- Sync with progress streaming and conflict detection

## Current Milestone

No active milestone. Ready for `/gsd:new-milestone` to define v2.0 scope.

## Candidate Features for v2.0

From v1.0 deferred items and user feedback:

- Configure P4 connection in app settings (currently uses environment)
- File history viewer
- External diff tool integration
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Connection status indicator
- Improved visual design
