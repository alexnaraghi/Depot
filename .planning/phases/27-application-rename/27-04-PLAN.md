<objective>
Verify complete rename with comprehensive grep and build/launch test.

Purpose: Ensure no stray p4now references remain and application works with new name
Output: Verified build with Depot branding throughout

  <name>Task 1: Comprehensive grep verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run comprehensive grep to find any remaining "p4now" references:

    ```bash
    rg -i "p4now" --glob "!.git" --glob "!node_modules" --glob "!target" --glob "!*.lock" --glob "!.planning/phases/*-SUMMARY.md" --glob "!.planning/phases/*-RESEARCH.md"
    ```

    Expected result: Zero matches (all p4now references should be gone from source code and configs).

    Acceptable exceptions (should NOT appear in active code):
    - Git history/commit messages (not searched)
    - Lock files (excluded)
    - Build artifacts (excluded)
    - Planning docs that reference historical context (excluded)

    If any matches found in source files (*.ts, *.tsx, *.rs, *.json, *.html), these must be fixed.

  <verify>Grep returns zero matches in source code and config files</verify>
  <done>No p4now references remain in source code, configs, or documentation (excluding git history and planning archive)</done>

  <name>Task 2: Full application build</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run full Tauri build to verify all renames work together:

    ```bash
    npm run tauri build
    ```

    This will:
    1. Run TypeScript compilation
    2. Build frontend with Vite
    3. Compile Rust backend
    4. Package as Windows installer

    Build must complete without errors.

    After build, verify the output binary exists:
    ```bash
    ls src-tauri/target/release/depot.exe
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run tauri build` completes successfully
    - `src-tauri/target/release/depot.exe` exists
  </verify>
  <done>Application builds successfully as "depot.exe"</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete application rename from p4now to Depot with version display and dynamic window title</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Launch the built application:
       - Run: `src-tauri\target\release\depot.exe`

    2. Verify window title:
       - Should show "Depot" in the window title bar

    3. Open Settings dialog (gear icon or Ctrl+,):
       - Look at the bottom of the dialog
       - Should show "v0.1.0 (Alpha)" in the footer

    4. Connect to a workspace:
       - After connection, window title should update to "Depot - [workspace-name]"

    5. Verify no "p4now" text visible anywhere in the UI
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all branding shows "Depot" correctly, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Grep finds zero p4now references in source code
2. Build completes successfully
3. depot.exe binary exists and launches
4. Window title shows "Depot" branding
5. Settings footer shows version
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Zero stray p4now references in codebase
- Application builds as depot.exe
- Visual verification confirms Depot branding throughout
- Version display works in Settings
- Dynamic window title works on connection
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/27-application-rename/27-04-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
