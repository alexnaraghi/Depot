## Problem

The settings menu isn't scrollable. When there are many settings, users can't access all of them without resizing the window. The layout should allow editing all settings comfortably without requiring window resize.

## Solution

TBD — likely add overflow-y scroll to the settings container, or restructure layout with sections/tabs so all settings are accessible within the default window size.
