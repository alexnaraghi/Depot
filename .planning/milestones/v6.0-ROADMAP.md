# Milestone v6.0: Public Launch Preparation

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-06
**Phases:** 26-30
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

Prepare Depot (renamed from P4Now) for public GitHub release with security audit, MIT licensing, comprehensive documentation, and automated release workflow. This milestone transformed the private development project into a public open-source tool ready for early adopter testing as v0.1.0 alpha.

## Phases

### Phase 26: Security Audit

**Goal**: Repository is safe for public release with no credentials or sensitive information in Git history or source code

**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase, BLOCKING all subsequent work)

**Requirements**: SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-03, SEC-04

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 26-01-PLAN.md - Automated security scanning with Gitleaks and TruffleHog
- [x] 26-02-PLAN.md - Manual code review, .planning audit, and .gitignore update

**Success Criteria:**
1. Gitleaks scan of entire Git history completes with zero credential detections
2. TruffleHog comprehensive audit confirms no verified secrets in repository
3. All source code files reviewed with no hardcoded credentials, API keys, or internal server names
4. .gitignore updated to prevent future credential commits (Tauri artifacts, certificates, credentials)
5. .planning/ directory audited and cleared for public showcase (no sensitive internal context)

### Phase 27: Application Rename

**Goal**: Application completely renamed from "p4now" to "Depot" with verified build and permanent bundle identifier set

**Depends on**: Phase 26 (security must be verified before any public-facing changes)

**Requirements**: REPO-01, REPO-02, REPO-03, REPO-04, REPO-05, REPO-06, REPO-07, REPO-08

**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 27-01-PLAN.md - Core rename (Cargo.toml, tauri.conf.json, package.json, index.html)
- [x] 27-02-PLAN.md - E2E test configuration updates
- [x] 27-03-PLAN.md - Version display and dynamic window title
- [x] 27-04-PLAN.md - Verification grep and build/launch test

**Success Criteria:**
1. MIT LICENSE file exists at project root with copyright 2026
2. package.json shows name "depot" and version "0.1.0"
3. Cargo.toml shows name "depot" and lib name "depot_lib"
4. tauri.conf.json shows productName "Depot", identifier "com.depot.app" (PERMANENT), title "Depot", and version "0.1.0"
5. All window titles, code comments, and documentation reference "Depot" (verified via grep)
6. Application builds successfully with `npm run tauri build`
7. Built application runs and displays "Depot" branding throughout UI

### Phase 28: Documentation

**Goal**: Comprehensive documentation exists for public GitHub repository with README, quick start, P4V comparison, and community guidelines

**Depends on**: Phase 27 (documentation references new "Depot" name)

**Requirements**: DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03, DOCS-04, DOCS-05, DOCS-06, DOCS-07, DOCS-08

**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 28-01-PLAN.md - Core README (overview, alpha disclaimer, quick start, P4V comparison, SmartScreen guidance)
- [x] 28-02-PLAN.md - Community files (CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, issue templates)
- [x] 28-03-PLAN.md - User verification checkpoint

**Success Criteria:**
1. README.md exists with project overview, demo GIF/screenshot, and feature highlights
2. README includes quick start guide with installation instructions and prerequisites
3. README includes P4V comparison section explaining Depot's advantages
4. README has prominent "Early Testing / v0.1 Alpha" disclaimer setting proper expectations
5. Prerequisites documented (Windows, Perforce CLI, p4.exe in PATH)
6. SmartScreen warning guidance included with bypass instructions for unsigned builds
7. .planning/ directory explained as showcase of agentic development methodology
8. CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, and issue templates exist
9. User has manually verified documentation

### Phase 29: Release Automation

**Goal**: GitHub Actions workflow automates release builds with NSIS and MSI installers published to GitHub Releases

**Depends on**: Phase 27 (rename complete), Phase 28 (documentation references workflows)

**Requirements**: DIST-01, DIST-02, DIST-04

**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 29-01-PLAN.md - Create release workflow with tauri-action and update CONTRIBUTING.md
- [x] 29-02-PLAN.md - Verify workflow via manual trigger and confirm release creation

**Success Criteria:**
1. .github/workflows/publish.yml workflow exists using tauri-apps/tauri-action
2. Workflow configured to build both NSIS (.exe) and MSI installers
3. Workflow tested with manual trigger and creates GitHub Release draft successfully
4. Release includes uploadable installers (depot_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe, depot_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi, checksums)
5. Workflow marks v0.x releases as pre-release automatically

### Phase 30: Final Validation

**Goal**: Release binaries validated on clean Windows installation and all features smoke tested before public launch

**Depends on**: Phase 26, 27, 28, 29 (all preparatory work complete)

**Requirements**: DIST-03, DIST-05

**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 30-01-PLAN.md - Manual verification and smoke testing

**Success Criteria:**
1. Version number displayed in app UI (About or settings) reading from tauri.conf.json automatically
2. Release binary tested on clean Windows VM with successful installation
3. All core features smoke tested (connection, file tree with 10K+ files, changelists, shelving, conflict resolution)
4. Settings persistence verified with new identifier (com.depot.app)
5. Installer SmartScreen bypass process validated and matches README guidance

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Dual-tool security scanning: Both Gitleaks and TruffleHog for comprehensive credential detection coverage
- Permanent bundle identifier: com.depot.app set before public release (cannot change after distribution)
- MIT license: Replaced AGPL-3.0 with permissive license for open-source community adoption
- .planning/ directory public: Showcase transparent agentic development methodology with educational value
- Unsigned binaries for v0.1: Cost ($100-500/year) not justified for early testing phase
- Manual workflow trigger: workflow_dispatch only for v0.1 testing; tag-based triggers deferred until workflow validated
- Draft-first release pattern: All releases created as drafts for human review before publishing
- Pre-release detection: v0.x versions automatically marked as pre-release via version pattern matching

**Issues Resolved:**

- Security audit cleared: Zero credentials detected across 522 commits and 144 source files
- Application identity established: "Depot" branding complete with permanent bundle identifier
- Public documentation complete: README, CONTRIBUTING, P4V comparison table all created
- Release automation validated: GitHub Actions workflow producing functional NSIS and MSI installers
- Manual verification complete: Core features tested in built application

**Issues Deferred:**

- Clean Windows VM testing: Deferred to post-v6.0 (not blocking for milestone completion)
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and SECURITY.md: Scoped out by user for post-v0.1 based on community need
- Code signing: Deferred to post-v0.1 based on adoption metrics ($100-500/year cost)
- Automated changelog generation: Deferred until stable release cadence established
- Tag-based workflow triggers: Deferred until manual workflow fully validated

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - milestone focused on documentation and configuration changes rather than code implementation.
