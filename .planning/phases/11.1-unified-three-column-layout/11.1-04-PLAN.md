<objective>
Wire up selection events from the file tree and changelist panel to the detail pane store, and add breadcrumb navigation.

Purpose: This connects the side columns to the center detail pane, making the three-column layout interactive. The breadcrumb enables back navigation through the drill-down stack.
Output: Clicking files and CLs in the side columns drives the detail pane. Breadcrumb shows navigation path with back support.

  <name>Task 1: Create DetailBreadcrumb and wire into DetailPane</name>
  <files>src/components/DetailPane/DetailBreadcrumb.tsx, src/components/DetailPane/DetailPane.tsx</files>
  <action>
**DetailBreadcrumb.tsx:**
Create a breadcrumb navigation bar that sits at the top of the detail pane.

**Rendering logic based on selection + history:**
- Read `selection` and `history` from useDetailPaneStore
- If `selection.type === 'none'`: Don't render breadcrumb at all (workspace summary has no nav)
- Build breadcrumb segments from history + current selection:
  - Each history item becomes a clickable segment
  - Current selection is the last segment (not clickable, bold)

**Segment labels:**
- `type: 'none'` -> "Workspace"
- `type: 'file'` -> filename extracted from depotPath
- `type: 'changelist'` -> `CL ${changelist.id}`
- `type: 'revision'` -> `#${revision.rev}`

**Layout:**
```
[← back] Workspace > CL 4521 > engine.cpp > #42
```

- Back arrow button (ArrowLeft icon from lucide): calls `useDetailPaneStore.getState().goBack()`. Disabled when history is empty.
- Segments separated by `>` (ChevronRight icon, small, muted)
- Clickable segments: on click, navigate to that history entry by calling `navigate()` with that selection and trimming history to that point. Implementation: store the index, and when clicked, set selection to that item and truncate history to items before it.
- Current (last) segment: bold, not clickable

**Keyboard shortcut:**
- Listen for Escape key in DetailPane: call `goBack()` if history exists, else call `clear()`.
- Add this in DetailPane.tsx using useEffect with keydown listener, NOT in the breadcrumb.

**Wire into DetailPane.tsx:**
- Add `<DetailBreadcrumb />` at the top of the detail pane, above the view content
- Add a divider line below breadcrumb when it's visible
  </action>
  <verify>`npx tsc --noEmit` passes</verify>
  <done>Breadcrumb shows navigation path with clickable segments and back button. Escape key navigates back.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Wire file tree and changelist panel selections to detail pane store</name>
  <files>src/components/FileTree/FileTree.tsx, src/components/FileTree/FileNode.tsx, src/components/ChangelistPanel/ChangelistPanel.tsx, src/components/ChangelistPanel/ChangelistNode.tsx</files>
  <action>
**FileNode.tsx (src/components/FileTree/FileNode.tsx) — wire file selection:**
- The main div at line ~41 has `onClick={() => node.isInternal && node.toggle()}` which only handles folder toggle. For file (leaf) nodes, this click does nothing.
- Modify this onClick handler to ALSO handle file clicks: when `!node.isInternal && file`, call `useDetailPaneStore.getState().selectFile(file.depotPath, file.localPath)`.
- Import `useDetailPaneStore` from `@/stores/detailPaneStore` at the top of the file.
- The `handleContextMenu` function (line ~25) already only fires on right-click — no changes needed there. The detail pane selection only fires on left-click via onClick.
- Keep existing behavior: folders still toggle on click, files now additionally update the detail pane.

**ChangelistNode.tsx (src/components/ChangelistPanel/ChangelistNode.tsx) — wire CL header click:**
- The CL header div at line ~72 has `onClick={() => node.isInternal && node.toggle()}` which only toggles expand/collapse.
- Modify this onClick to ALSO call `useDetailPaneStore.getState().selectChangelist(changelist)` when the CL header is clicked (the `node.isInternal` branch, since CL headers are internal/parent nodes).
- For file rows within the CL (the else branch starting at line ~148), add an onClick that calls `useDetailPaneStore.getState().selectFile(file.depotPath, file.localPath, changelist.id)`. The file row div currently has no onClick — add one. The parent CL id can be obtained from the node's parent: `node.parent?.data as P4Changelist`.
- Import `useDetailPaneStore` from `@/stores/detailPaneStore`.
- The onContextMenu handler (line ~73) is separate and should NOT trigger detail pane selection — no changes needed there.

**Important:** Keep all existing behavior intact. The file tree and CL panel should continue to work as before (expand/collapse, drag-drop, context menus). The detail pane selection is ADDITIVE — it doesn't replace existing click handlers, it adds to them.
  </action>
  <verify>`npx tsc --noEmit` passes. Run `npm run dev`, click a file in the tree — center pane should show file detail. Click a CL header — center pane should show CL detail.</verify>
  <done>Clicking files in tree shows file detail in center pane. Clicking CL headers shows CL detail. Breadcrumb updates to reflect navigation path. Back button and Escape navigate backward. All existing FileTree and ChangelistPanel behavior preserved.</done>

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
2. Click file in tree -> detail pane shows FileDetailView
3. Click CL header -> detail pane shows ChangelistDetailView
4. Click file in CL detail -> drills into FileDetailView with breadcrumb "CL 123 > file.cpp"
5. Click history row in file detail -> drills into RevisionDetailView
6. Back button pops navigation stack
7. Escape key navigates back or clears selection
8. Breadcrumb segments are clickable
9. Drag-drop, context menus, and all existing behavior still work

<success_criteria>
Side columns drive the detail pane via selection. Breadcrumb navigation works with clickable segments and back button. All existing functionality preserved.
