  <what-built>
Complete documentation suite for public GitHub repository:

1. **README.md** — Project overview, alpha disclaimer, quick start guide, P4V comparison table, SmartScreen guidance, .planning mention, license
2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Development setup, prerequisites, PR process
3. **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** — Contributor Covenant 2.1
4. **SECURITY.md** — Vulnerability reporting process
5. **.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/** — Bug report and feature request templates
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Review README.md:**
1. Open `README.md` in editor or preview
2. Verify overview accurately describes Depot
3. Verify alpha disclaimer is prominent and sets proper expectations
4. Verify quick start instructions are accurate for your setup
5. Verify P4V comparison table is fair and honest about gaps
6. Verify SmartScreen guidance matches actual Windows behavior

**Review community files:**
1. Open `CONTRIBUTING.md` — does development setup match your environment?
2. Open `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — acceptable community standards?
3. Open `SECURITY.md` — add your email for vulnerability reports
4. Check `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — templates useful?

**Screenshot action needed:**
- README has placeholder: `![Depot main interface](docs/screenshot.png)`
- You need to capture a screenshot of Depot showing:
  - File tree with files visible
  - Pending tab or changelist
  - Connection indicator (connected state)
- Save as `docs/screenshot.png` (create `docs/` directory)

**Note any corrections needed.**
