<objective>
Create comprehensive README.md for public GitHub repository with project overview, alpha disclaimer, quick start guide, and P4V comparison table.

Purpose: README is the first thing users see. It must clearly communicate what Depot is, set proper expectations for alpha software, and help users get started quickly.

Output: README.md at project root, replacing existing placeholder content

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create comprehensive README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the existing README.md (which contains TruffleHog documentation from security testing) with Depot's public README.

**Structure per CONTEXT.md locked decisions:**

1. **Header** (brief)
   - Project name: "Depot"
   - One-line description: Modern Windows Perforce GUI

2. **Overview** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What Depot is: Windows GUI replacement for P4V for daily development work
   - Core value: "The user is never blocked" — operations are cancellable, errors are non-blocking, app stays responsive
   - Tech highlights: Tauri 2.0, React 19, handles 10,000+ files with progressive loading and instant search
   - Mention single screenshot below (placeholder text: `![Depot main interface](docs/screenshot.png)`)

3. **Alpha Disclaimer** (prominent warning box)
   - Use blockquote with warning emoji or bold text
   - v0.1.0 is early testing software
   - Expect bugs and missing features
   - Settings location: com.depot.app
   - "Please report issues on GitHub"

4. **Quick Start**
   - Prerequisites section:
     - Windows 10 or later
     - Perforce Helix Core server (P4D) access
     - p4.exe command-line client in PATH
   - Installation:
     - Download from GitHub Releases
     - Run installer (NSIS or MSI)
     - SmartScreen warning subsection (see below)
   - First workflow:
     - Launch Depot
     - Enter connection settings (P4PORT, P4USER, P4CLIENT)
     - Browse workspace, check out files, make changes, submit

5. **SmartScreen Warning** (subsection of Quick Start)
   - Explain: Depot is unsigned (no code signing certificate yet)
   - Windows SmartScreen may block first run
   - Bypass: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"
   - This is safe — source code is open and auditable

6. **P4V Comparison Table**
   - Format: | Feature | P4V | Depot |
   - Include performance wins:
     - Startup time
     - File tree with 10K+ files (progressive loading)
     - Search (instant fuzzy search)
   - Include UX wins:
     - Non-blocking operations (never freezes)
     - Modern dark theme
     - Command palette
     - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Acknowledge gaps (per CONTEXT.md: "honest about gaps"):
     - Branch/integrate operations: Not yet implemented
     - Stream graph visualization: Not yet implemented
     - Time-lapse view: Not yet implemented
     - Admin tools: Not yet implemented
   - Neutral respectful tone (per CONTEXT.md)

7. **Built with Claude** (brief mention)
   - Single line: "Built with [Claude](https://claude.ai) using the GSD agentic methodology. Development history in `.planning/`."

8. **License**
   - MIT License
   - Link to LICENSE file

  <verify>
- File exists: `ls README.md`
- Contains key sections: `grep -c "Overview\|Alpha\|Quick Start\|P4V\|SmartScreen\|License" README.md` returns 6+
- No TruffleHog references: `grep -c "TruffleHog\|trufflehog" README.md` returns 0
- References Depot correctly: `grep -c "Depot" README.md` returns 10+
  </verify>
  <done>README.md exists with Overview, Alpha Disclaimer, Quick Start (with SmartScreen guidance), P4V Comparison table, .planning mention, and License section. No TruffleHog content remains.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. README.md exists at project root
2. README contains all required sections per CONTEXT.md decisions
3. Alpha disclaimer is prominent (appears before Quick Start)
4. P4V comparison table includes both wins and acknowledged gaps
5. SmartScreen guidance is clear and actionable
6. No references to TruffleHog or other unrelated projects
